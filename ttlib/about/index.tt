                  <p>Since the general election in 2010, Twitter use in the UK has
                    expanded massively. You're no-one if you're not on Twitter.</p>
                  <p>With that in mind, this site gives you a simple way to track what
                    candidates in a general election are saying on Twitter.</p>
                  <p>We have created a Twitter list for each constituency. Each list is
                    automatically populated with the Twitter usernames of all the known
                    candidates in that constituency. We have a page for each constituency
                    which displays what the candidates are saying on Twitter.</p>
                  <p>If you find this site useful, please

                  <p><a href="https://dave.org.uk/">Dave Cross</a> was convinced that the 2010 general
                    election would be dominated by Twitter. He was wrong, but now thinks that if he
                    makes the same prediction for every general election he'll get it right eventually.</p>
                  <p>He has voted in every general election since 1983 and has even been known to be
                    one of those annoying people who try to collect your voter number at the polling
                    station. On another occasion he stayed up all night trying to ensure that the
                    Guardian web site published results as quickly as possible.</p>
                  <p>He is <a href="https://twitter.com/">@davorg</a> on Twitter. And would love to
                    hear whether you found this site at all useful.</p>
