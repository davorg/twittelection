            <p>We have created a Twitter list for each of the 650 parliamentary constituencies in the UK and populated those lists with the known candidates from those constituencies (using data from those lovely people at <a href="https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/">Democracy Club</a>). This will, hopefully, make it easier for you to find your candidates on Twitter and follow what they are saying.</p>
            <p>Just go to our <a href="/c/">constituencies page</a> and find your constituency on the list.</p>
